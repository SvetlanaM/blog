Title: I work
Slug: site_3_work
Summary:  ![](../images/home/box-gray.png)

Currently, I work for [Red Hat](http://redhat.com)
on the [FreeIPA](http://freeipa.org) project:
an open-source identity management framework.

In addition to [my favorite language](http://python.org),
my work involves fighting [mutant dogs from the underworld](http://kerberos.org/software),
a hipster [NoSQL database](http://directory.fedoraproject.org) (which was cool *way* before NoSQL was cool),
and a [certificate authority](http://pki.fedoraproject.org).
