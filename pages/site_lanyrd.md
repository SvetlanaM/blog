Title: I talk

I also share my knowledge in various presentations.
Most of my talks happen at meetups of the
[Python users group](http://python.cz) in Brno,
which I help organize.

My talks can be found on [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/profile/encukou/).
Unfortunately, a lot of my talks have been slide-less lately,
and good recordings aren't that easy to make.
You shold come in person!
