Title: Dennis Ritchie has died.

The Economist has a [very good article](http://www.economist.com/node/2724348)
on some of his work; you should read it if you haven't done so already.
I quote:

In other words, he Did the Right Thing; he found the answer that is, in
retrospect, obvious. That is the mark of a genius.

His ideas stood the test of time. He has reached a local maximum: Java or C++
or C# are object-oriented languages; C is the procedural language. Sure, there
may be something better than C, in some sense of the word.
It's like Newton's laws being surpassed by Einstein's relativity – C will still
be there.
Still valid, still useful, still used.

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
We have lost a humble genius, a mathematician, an architect of the abstract.
It's sad that most poeple will never be able to appreciate the beauty of things
he has done.
Perhaps that, too, is the mark of a genius.
